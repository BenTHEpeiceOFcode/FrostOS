# My Plans for this OS
Because LMNet is a good Bash OS, I want an grapical os. I create the startup file and I plan to create a Launcher like the Ubuntus Unity.
I know that this isn't my os so if you don't like my Ideas you can write it here so I delete the files. 
I will use /Programs/<Name> to store Programs there, like OneOS. 
```
Files inside:
 - startup (the Code) (Required)
 - data (using the AppData function)
 - icon (yeah you know)
 - program (Table with Informations) 
   - Description
   - alias
   - Update URL / Repo
   - Author
   
...< Add your Ideas here>
```

I also will create functions and tools so that you don't need much code for simple data. Like my AppData.load(). 
I also want to integrate much APIs of LMNet, because I domt want wo write them again. I will pull it from the LMNet Repo, so I hope it's ok!

I hope that my Code isn't a problem.
